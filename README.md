#  Airline Flight Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of airline flight data using Python. The project is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook that walks through data loading, cleaning, visualization, and basic analytics to extract meaningful insights from flight-related datasets.

#   Project Overview
The aim of this project is to:

Analyze trends in flight delays and cancellations

Identify factors influencing flight performance

Visualize airline routes, traffic, and delay patterns

Provide insights that could help in airline operation optimizations

#  Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization



#  Installation:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
