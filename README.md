# Airline flight data analysis

# # 🛫 Airline Flight Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of airline flight data using Python. The project is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook that walks through data loading, cleaning, visualization, and basic analytics to extract meaningful insights from flight-related datasets.

# # 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to:

Analyze trends in flight delays and cancellations

Identify factors influencing flight performance

Visualize airline routes, traffic, and delay patterns

Provide insights that could help in airline operation optimizations

# # 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn (optional) – if any modeling is included

# # Installation:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
